Notes : 
1. One debugging .h file pu_debug.h and one debugging function MyDB_BufferManager::showBufferPool() is added for debugging purpose.
2. Two classes are added : PCB and PageHandle_Proxy. PCB is for page control block. PageHandle_Proxy is for proxies for page handles inside buffer manager.
3. Except for MyDB_BufferManager, other classes or added functions are ill-documented.
4. git info is also zipped... don't know how to avoid zipping it. 
5. Git repository for this project can be found at https://github.com/putoong/BufferManager.git
